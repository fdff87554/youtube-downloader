"""Counts the collected items that carry an ``xfail`` marker.

Loaded by ``check-conformance-drift.sh`` with ``-p``, and writes its
count to the path in ``CONFORMANCE_XFAIL_COUNT_FILE``.

Why a plugin, rather than the script reading pytest's output: the
count then depends on neither how the test path was spelled nor how
verbose pytest happened to be. An earlier version grepped the listing
for lines beginning with the path it had been given. Measured on a
module with 35 ``xfail`` items, it reported all 35 for a plain relative
path and ``0`` for each of ``./tests/...``, an absolute path, and the
same path under ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS=-q`` -- exiting 0 every time.

Why not a test inside the conformance module: a module-level
``pytestmark`` marks that test too, so its failure is reported as an
``xfail`` and the run stays green. A check cannot police the module it
lives in. Hooks defined in a test module are not called either.

Reading the collected markers is also what makes an aliased import, a
module-level ``pytestmark`` and a marker added from a ``conftest.py``
all count the same.
