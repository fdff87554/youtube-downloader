"""``CONFORMANCE_XFAILS`` still names tests that exist.

An entry that matches nothing is stale: the test it excused was
renamed or deleted, and leaving it behind reserves a slot in
``xfail_budget`` for a gap nobody can close.

The names are resolved against the imported module rather than
against the items pytest collected. A check that reads the collection
cannot tell a renamed test from a narrowed selection, so it fails on
``pytest tests/test_ytdlp_conformance.py::TestTheExtractorPinHolds``
-- an ordinary thing to type while debugging. Resolving against the
module removes the question instead of answering it.
